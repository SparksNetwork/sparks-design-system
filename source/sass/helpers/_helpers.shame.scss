/**
 * Rules of Shame
 *
 * 1. If it’s a hack, it goes here.
 * 2. Document all hacks _fully_:
 *     1. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
 *     2. Why was this needed?
 *     3. How does this fix it?
 *     4. How might you fix it properly given more time?
 * 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it,
 *    then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
 * 4. Try to clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
 *     1. Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate
 *        actual sprint time to it.

/**
 * HTML5 hidden attribute fix.
 *
 * This hack relates to browser support for the HTML5 hidden attribute.
 * The hack is needed to support otherwise unsupported browsers, such as
 * IE 10, IE Mobile 10, and Blackberry Browser, and will work back to IE 6.
 * By adding adding `hidden` as an attribute selector, we can hide the
 * element with CSS when the browser doesn’t natively do it. The hack can
 * safely be removed when the codebase shouldn’t support the unsupported
 * browsers.
