title: Heading Large
---
The large heading utility helps create large headings. On smaller form factors, 
these appear the same size as medium headings, but bolder. On larger form 
factors, they are lighter and bigger.

**These are rarely used in the app** and are reserved for extremely large text 
to showcase data (such as totals or stats).
