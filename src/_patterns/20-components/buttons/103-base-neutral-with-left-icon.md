title: Base Neutral With Left Icon
---
Use a neutral icon button for buttons with an icon on the left or right (not 
for stateful buttons). Add the `c-button--neutral` class to `c-button`.

The SVG inside receives the `c-button__icon` class. You can position the icon 
on the right or the left using `c-button__icon--right` or 
`c-button__icon--left`, which apply the correct amount of space between the 
icon and the text.
